Accompanying Repo for Anuga Tutorial


Make sure to use the repo here (https://github.com/paulsouthard1/anuga_core) to install anuga!  Or, at least to determine what changes I made to implement a constant discharge inflow boundary.  Installation instructions are the same as for the regular anuga_core repository.
